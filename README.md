# The Stonemont Chronicles

<img src="https://static.jam.vg/raw/eae/z/6a64.png" width="200" align="left" style="margin: 8px">
<p>In The Stonemont Chronicles, you become the ruler of your own kingdom, Stonemont. Try to keep your empire for as long as you can by making important decisions using the help of you councillors. But beware: each councillor also has their own (more or less secret) personal agenda, and won't necessarily always advise you what's best for the kingdom.</p>  

The Stonemont Chronicles was originally made for Ludum Dare 39. Check out it's [Ludum Dare page here!](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/the-stonemont-chronicles)  

The game is made using [Godot 3.0 (Alpha 1)](https://godotengine.org/). The project files in this repository might not work in other versions of the Godot engine.
